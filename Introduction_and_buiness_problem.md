# Introduction and Business Problem
Covid-19 has affected the whole world. The virus has defeated many governments, cities and countries. People’s living habit is greatly impacted by the virus and the corresponding lock-down or quarantine measures adopted by government. A lot of traditional business has to adapt to post-Covid environment. For example, restaurants were closed temporarily for a few months because the government locked the city down or permanently because the restaurants just couldn’t stand the rent without doing any business.

However, neither the virus nor the lock down could stop people from eating. People either go to supermarkets, buy food and cook the food by themselves or they simply buy takeaway from fast food shops. Indeed, a lot of takeaway restaurants and fast food shops seize this opportunity and have expanded their business.

If you are an owner of a traditional dine-in restaurant or an investor who is looking for opportunities in the **F&B industry**, you probably start thinking how I can use location and other data to explore business opportunities in the F&B sector.

The United States is one of most affected countries by the Covid. In cities like **New York**, people are not allowed to dine-in for almost one year and they cannot tell if the food of a restaurant is good by visiting the restaurant. As a result, a lot of people look up information like rating, comments on the internet to determine whether a restaurant is a good one. How can we leverage the available data to understand the F&B market better?

The objective is to **segregate the different neighborhoods** of a city into different groups or clusters based on a few criteria. Then we summarize the characteristics of each cluster so that it gives a choice to the reader which specific cluster or group of customers they would like to focus on. In this exercise, we will use New York City as an example.
